1. Installing node js
(a) Download node js and install from https://nodejs.org/en/download
(b) After installation, open CMD and check the version. This also tells whether it has been installed.
node --version
(c) Now verify whether "npm" is working. This is Node Package Manager that is used to install the libraries/packages and dependencies.
npm --version
(d) Now initiate the node js application by running
npm i
within \backend directory
from your CMD.
This will install all the dependencies mentioned in the package.json.
If package.json is NOT present then run
npm init 
to create a new application.
