1. Create the virtual environment
Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
On windows:
(a) python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
(b) In Windows PowerShell, activate using, <venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1
(c) In Windows CMD, activate using, <venv>\Scripts\activate.bat

2. Vscode setup
(a) Create a folder .vscode
(b) Create file within .vscode as settings.json
(c) Add the full path of "python" from the virtual environment's python as below
{"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/path/to/new/virtual/environment's python3.10"}
(d) Add the python related extensions to vscode
autopep8 (pip install autopep8 https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/. It automatically formats the python code.).
Pylance (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance. Vscode extension that provides Python IntelliSense experience.)
Pylint (pip install pylint https://pypi.org/project/pylint/. Install if you need to enforce coding standards.)


3. If you find custom created module not found issues then Make sure that the PYTHONPATH is SET as
(a) For Linux based, export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:your/src/folder"
(b) For Windows using CMD, set PYTHONPATH=c:\path\to\my\modules
At times you may find error - No module named 'pkg_resources' - then run the command
pip install --upgrade setuptools

set PYTHONPATH=C:\Users\Sandip_Biswas\iWork\iProject\RNA\sangini-project\bioinfo_apis\src;C:\Users\Sandip_Biswas\iWork\iProject\RNA\sangini-project\bioinfo_apis\src\api;C:\Users\Sandip_Biswas\iWork\iProject\RNA\sangini-project\bioinfo_apis\src\tests;

4. Install all the dependecies mentioned in the requirements.txt file using the pip install command.
BEFORE INSTALLING package or module MAKE SURE you have activated your virtual environment.
While working further in the project you can update your requirements.txt by running the command

5. The main project related packages used are
biopython (https://biopython.org/). This is used for biological RNA sequence calculations.
seqfold (https://github.com/Lattice-Automation/seqfold). This is used to predict the Zuker RNA structure and the minimum free energy.
numpy (https://numpy.org/). This is used for numerical and array handling.

coverage (https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.4.0/). This is used to measure what is the extent the code has been covered when the automated tests are run.
Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/). This provides the relevant framework to expose the python features as REST APIs.
pytest (https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/). This is used to write the test cases.

6. To start the flask application, from CMD naigate to src and run python app.py.
